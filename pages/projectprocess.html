							<h1>Data Analytic Project Work Flow</h1>
							<h2>Capstone Project Outline</h2>
						</header>

						<p style="text-align:justify;"> Below is the typical Data Analytic guideline process workflow provided by NTUC Learning Hub.
							As a new entrant to the data analytics world, these workflow definitely helped and provide a
							starting point for me and my fellow trainees to gain better understanding.
						</p>

						<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Scope of Work</strong><br>

						<p style="text-align:justify;">
							The main aim of the capstone project is to exhibit the five stages of the data lifecycle
							through the use of the tool: MS Excel. Participants, as part of the capstone project,
							will have to exhibit the following:
							<ul>
								<li>Data collection from various sources</li>
								<li>Business needs gathering</li>
								<li>Story building in relation to business needs</li>
								<li>Data Preparation</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
										<li>ETL</li>
										<li>Data Cleaning</li>
										<li>Data Transformation</li>
									</ul>
								<li>Exploratory Data Analysis using Excel/Power BI/Python/PPT</li>
								<li>Creating Interactive Dashboard and Visualization using Excel/
									Power BI/Python Dashboards</li>
								<li>Communicating insights derived based on decided business needs</li>
								<li>Presenting to the stakeholders</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						
						<p style="text-align:justify;">
							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">For each stage:</strong><br><br>
							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Data collection from various sources</strong><br>
							Firstly, a domain of choice can be chosen on which analysis needs to be
							done. Areas could be sales, marketing, finance, retail, healthcare, or
							others. Data can be collected from various sources on the web such as:<br><br>

							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Public Data Sources:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>data.gov.sg</li>
								<li>www.data.gov</li>
								<li>www.data.world</li>
								<li>AWS public datasets</li>
								<li>Google public datasets</li>
								<li>Socrata open data</li>
								<li>Kaggle</li>
								<li>Others</li>
								<li><a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-great-sites-with-free-data-sets-581ac8f6334">DataScience Free Data Set Links</a></li>
								<li>APIs provided by various websites</li>
								<li>Data from your organization (if permitted to use)</li><br>
							

							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Business needs gathering</strong><br>
							This is the stage whereby the learner is to decide on a convincing
							business need which can be used for the chosen dataset. The learner
							is to discuss with the mentor on their ideas for the business needs.
							If the learner has a real-world scenario with a real business or company,
							he/she is encouraged to speak with the mentor about it.<br><br>

							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Story building</strong><br>
							After gathering the business needs, the next task is to build a
							storyline behind the data and the business needs. This exercise is
							to be iterated and refined based on the business needs.<br><br>						

							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Creating tables and Loading data into Excel</strong><br>
							With the knowledge of Excel gained in the previous courses, import
							the data into Excel and create the required tables.<br><br>						

							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Data Preparation</strong><br>
							After creating all the required tables and loading in the raw data,
							perform data cleaning and transformation operations. You could:<br><br>

							<ul>
								<li>Clean unwanted data</li>
								<li>Create and derive new columns</li>
								<li>Remove anomalies and outliers in the data</li>
								<li>Remove inconsistencies</li>
								<li>And others.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Exploratory Data Analysis using Excel</strong><br>
							Using the methods learnt during the Excel course, perform analysis
							on the data to derive useful insights. Make use of different excel
							tables, pivot charts and data summarization techniques.<br><br>

							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Creating Interactive Dashboard and Visualization using Excel Dashboards</strong><br>
							Once all the data has been prepared in Excel, import the data
							into Excel directly from SQL. Create required the pivot tables and
							charts based on the business needs and the story which has been
							defined, in the form of dashboards which help in visualizing the
							data and also in drawing useful insights. Create the dashboards with
							the intention of drilling down further into the data. Exposing the
							insights which you have found to help you tell a story to the stakeholders.<br><br>							

							<strong style="color: darkslategrey;">Presenting to the stakeholders</strong><br>
							Once you have created all the required reports and dashboards,
							you would be presenting the same to the stakeholders
							(mentors/trainers). Present your dashboards in a way which will
							help you drive the presentation towards the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment.<br>							

							The mentors and trainers will guide you through the whole process.
							Discuss every stage with your mentors and trainers to understand
							whether you are proceeding in the right direction or not. Put
							your creative thinking caps on and use the project to exhibit
							all your skills, like in a real organization!<br><br>
